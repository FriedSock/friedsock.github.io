<p>If you are reading this page, you have decided to, or are considering being part of a study for one or both of the <a href="https://github.com/FriedSock/smeargle">Smeargle</a> or <a href="https://github.com/FriedSock/ctrlpsimilar">CtrlpSimilar</a> plugins for Vim and Git.</p>

<h3>
<a name="smeargle" class="anchor" href="#smeargle"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Smeargle</h3>
<p>Smeargle is a plugin to study how we can radiate version control information to developers in real time. The emphasis of the tool is to change the text background colour to reflect the Age/Author of the code you are reading akin to a  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">Choropleth Map</a> take a look at the  <a href="https://github.com/FriedSock/smeargle">project page</a> for usage demos, and installation instructions.</p>

<h3>
<a name="ctrlp-similar" class="anchor" href="#ctrlp-similar"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CtrlpSimilar</h3>
<p>CtrlpSimilar builds upon the existing ctrlp plugin, a fuzzy logic file searcher. Except it aims to predict which files you would like to open, based on the version control history, and the current coding context. Again, take a look at the  <a href="https://github.com/FriedSock/ctrlp-similar">project page</a> for usage demos, and installation instructions.</p>

<h3>
<a name="whattodo" class="anchor" href="#whattodo"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What to do</h3>

<p> If you would like to proceed, simply send me an email at jbtwentythree'at'gmail.com (replace 'at' with @) saying with which plugin(s) you are trying out, and you will receive a short questionnaire about your experience after a few days usage period. In the case of CtrlpSimilar I ask that you include a logfile in your response, if you have any concerns about this: consult the project page or send me an email. If you have any trouble during installation from the instructions given, or you have any questions at all, send me an email and I will respond as soon as possible.</p>

<p> Thank you very much for reading/taking part. <br> <br>
